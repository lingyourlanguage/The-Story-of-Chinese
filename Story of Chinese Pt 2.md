*In Part 2, we take a closer look at the development of the "Chinese language" in the 20th century. In [Part 1](https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=5) of this series, we started at the origins of Chinese civilization and the first dynasties a few thousand years ago and worked our way up to the founding of the Republic of China in 1912. In [Part 3](https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=3) we will return to our main questions: is Chinese one language? What do we mean when we say the "Chinese language"?*

#### Chinese in the Republic of China

With the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 came increased enthusiasm to put into motion the steps agreed upon in 1911 (see Part 1). And what better way to do so than the Commission for Unifying Reading Pronunciation (*Dúyīn Tо̆ngyī Huì*)? The Ministry of Education called experts and other qualified people, and when all 80 people arrived in February 1933, they were ready to start.  They had three key questions to answer:

1.	How should the characters be pronounced?
2.	What would the sounds of the language be?
3.	How would those sounds be written down phonetically?

The conference was full of naïve arguments with absolutely no linguistic foundation – but which were not lacking in passion. One such argument was that “Germany is strong because its language contains many voiced sounds and China is weak because Mandarin lacks them.”[^17]  Months went by with no progress. 

It's not hard to see why they had such trouble picking a standard: the “Chinese language” was really an extremely diverse group of languages. Though not a perfect analogy by any means, it was as if the European nations had gotten together to decide on some **one** Romance language to replace Latin. 

Eventually, Wang Zhao, the leader of the Mandarin dialect delegates, proposed a one-province-one-vote system. The Mandarin delegation obviously stood to benefit with this, because there were simply more Mandarin-speaking delegates at the conference than speakers of other dialects. No one was fooled by this suggestion. Tempers rose, leading to such events as the incident between Zhao and Wang Rongbao, leader of the southern delegation, where Rongbao was chased out after being misheard.[^18] 

The commission powered through, and after three month’s work on debating and making decisions - which included going through the pronunciation of about 6,500 characters individually – they achieved their standardization goals. The pronunciation they decided on, which was later known as “Old National Pronunciation” (*Lăo guóyīn*), did not actually match how *anyone* spoke. Instead, it was an artificial mix of Beijing Mandarin with features from other dialects.[^19] 

Due to political instability, it would not be until 1919 that the Dictionary of National Pronunciation (*Guóyīn zìdiăn*) produced by the delegates in 1913 would be released. In 1920 the Ministry of Education decreed that this new, standardized Guoyu would be promoted across the country as *the* standard, and that *baíhuà*, a writing system that had been in place since the Tang dynasty (618 – 907 CE), would become the language of literacy.[^20]  This meant that students would be taught in Guoyu, as opposed to *guówen* (the “national written language”). 

**This was a radical shift from the previous method of teaching,** which had students learning to read and write in a style based upon Old Chinese. Now, rather than focusing on a system of reading and writing that had crystallized long ago, students would be working on their modern, spoken Chinese.

There was just one problem: no one actually was quite sure how to pronounce everything – in fact, most people weren’t even able to. Beijing and other natives of northern China had trouble with features that didn’t exist in their dialects anymore, and southerners were essentially being told to learn a new language. One scholar, Wang Pu, released recordings of the dictionary to help, but he ran into a big problem: not even *he* was able to pronounce the sounds without a noticeable Beijing accent. Another scholar, the American-trained linguist Yuen Ren Chao, took over and produced a new set of recordings and even taught others with them, but he too ran into a problem: he was the only one really able to teach the pronunciations![^21] 

This left the National Language Movement in a bit of a pickle. People began to doubt the national standard. Should there – or even could there – be any standardized pronunciation? 

Two camps emerged, one in favor of the standard at the time, one in favor of a new standard. Those in favor of the current standard became the *guóyīn* ‘national pronunciation’ school. Those who favored a new one became the *Jīngyīn* ‘Beijing pronunciation’ school, because they argued that the national standard should be based on the Beijing dialect *without* the added features. Yet another committee was convened – and several times, at that – this time the 1923 Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language (*guóyŭ Tо̄ngyī Chóubèihuì*). In the end they sided with the Beijing pronunciation school and repealed the Old Pronunciation in favor of a New National Pronunciation (*Xīn guóyīn*) based entirely on the Beijing dialect.[^22]  

**This was a huge step in the history of standard spoken Chinese.** 

For all of Chinese history up to this point, more attention had always been paid to *literary pronunciations* of words, rather than to how people *actually* pronounced words in their day-to-day lives. With the New National Pronunciation, that had all changed: now, for the first time ever, the spoken version was taking precedent over the literary.[^23] 

#### Chinese in the People’s Republic of China

1949 saw the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and with it, another wave of enthusiasm for language reform – and yes, more committees and conferences and commissions. The PRC was different than earlier governments. It saw a standardized, common national language as an opportunity to help solve socioeconomic inequalities and help unify the nation as a whole. They argued that only when the population could communicate with each other effectively and have easier linguistic access to education, would they start to feel united as a single nation.[^24] 

To this end they played a much more active role in all of this language reform business, and after five years of planning they organized two major conferences with the goal of solving the same issues as always: What should the standards be for Modern Spoken Chinese and Modern Written Chinese? In addition, they wanted to design yet another new system, but this time to go along with a brand new set of simplified characters.[^25] 

The first conference, in October 1955, was the National Conference on Script Reform (*Quánguó Wénzì Găigé Huìyì*). At this conference, experts passed a resolution defining a new, standard form of Chinese called *pŭtо̄nghuà* ‘common language’, based upon northern dialects with Beijing pronunciation.[^26]  The choice of a northern Mandarin dialect as the basis for Putonghua was not meant to reflect bias in favor of the north (as perhaps it did 20 years earlier), but rather the practical consideration that a significant majority of the population already spoke it.[^27]  At the second conference, in February 1956, the Symposium on the Standardization of Modern Chinese (*Xiàndài Hànyŭ Guīfànhuà Xuéshù Huìyì*), that definition was solidified.[^28]  

Deciding how everything should be pronounced was a lot easier this time, since the pronunciation actually matched how real people spoke. A committee made quick work of the task and published their results in two dictionaries, the New China Dictionary (*Xīnhuá zìdiăn*) and the Modern Chinese Dictionary (*Xiàndài Hànyŭ cídiăn*).[^29] 

The government really invested in this new standard. There were nationwide promotional campaigns and pamphlets explaining the similarities and differences between Putonghua and local dialects. There were committees set up at the provincial and major city levels to get the transition to Putonghua started as quickly and efficiently as possible and workshops to train qualified instructors who could spread it throughout the provinces. Putonghua became the language of schools and of mass media, and everyone was encouraged to learn and use it at work. The 1958 introduction of *Hànyŭ pīnyīn*, the new phonetic system, only increased Putonghua’s reach, especially into southern areas.

The promotion of Putonghua was similar to other mass movements in China since the founding of the PRC in many ways. It began with lots of publicity and calls for popular support from high-ranking government officials, had national conferences to set agendas and come up with appropriate solutions, and ended with the implementation of the solutions by means of mass media and government agencies. 

That is not to say that everything went perfectly. As with other mass movements, excitement dropped quickly as attention turned to other important issues of the time, and so in the 1960s and 70s little attention was paid to the issue of language reform. Only after the Cultural Revolution from 1966-76 did the promotion of Putonghua resume, with the government including an article (19) in the [1982 constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/China_2004?lang=en) that stated that Putonghua would be promoted across the country. Even still, there was less enthusiasm than there had been earlier in the 20th century.

#### Chinese Today

By and large, the implementation of Putonghua was a huge success. By 1984, 90% of the Chinese population could understand it, and 50% communicate. Compare this to just 30 years prior, when only 41% understood it.[^30]  It has had remarkable success in regions where a wide variety of dialects are spoken, as it provides for a convenient, useful, and high-prestige lingua franca. On the other hand, in regions that either do not have much linguistic diversity, or that already have a highly prestigious dialect, Putonghua is not as readily taken up by the population.  Putonghua is seen as a marker of status, of educational attainment. 

In a bilingual society, there is usually one language or dialect considered the *high variety* and one cosnidered the *low variety*. Each is associated with certain functions, contexts, attitudes, and values. The high variety is used for written literature, for official functions, education, and so on. The low variety is considered informal, better suited for use among friends and family or in private.  

Putonghua is clearly the high variety in modern-day China, and it has reached this level for the political, cultural, and economic reasons explored above. It is such a force to be reckoned with that other dialects, such as Min, Wu, and Xiang, are moving towards it in terms of their phonology, vocabulary, and even grammatical features. It is being used more and more in informal settings, demonstrating just how much it has become a part of everyday life for a huge segment of the population.[^31]

All of this is not to say that Putonghua goes unchallenged in China, and that the only debates are about the right way to write it and the right name to call it. Pockets of resistance have sprung up across the country, some bigger than others, fighting for recognition of local dialects in a variety of contexts.

Take Cantonese, the biggest pocket of resistance. Cantonese has been highly prestigious at least since the Ming dynasty, with its popularity reflecting the economic success of the Cantonese-speaking area, especially since the 1980s.[^32] It’s also the largest of the Yue dialects, spoken by 4-5% of China’s 1.3 billion people – about 60 million people – primarily in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and by up to 11 million outside of China, especially in the United States.[^33]  

Cantonese speakers form arguably the most well-defined sub-group of the Han Chinese, with a highly developed sense of group identity – Cantonese speakers will identify themselves as “Cantonese” and see their dialect as standard – an independent language.[^34]  One way this can be seen is in their literature. Cantonese is the *only* dialect besides Mandarin to have a rich literature, though this writing, as with writing in other dialects, is often suppressed in mainland China.[^35]  

But there are the other, smaller pockets of resistance as well. [In June 2018](https://qz.com/1314432/a-debate-over-the-word-for-grandmother-in-shanghai-schools-exposes-a-linguistic-and-political-rift-in-china/), photos of some elementary school textbooks in Shanghai started to be shared more and more on the social network Weibo. These textbooks had the word lăo lao for “grandmother” – the Potanghua term – rather than wài pó, the Shanghainese (Wu dialect) word. The reasons for the heated debates of the 20th century and earlier over which dialect to make standard are still at play today: speakers of non-Mandarin dialects often feel under attack by the seemingly unstoppable force of Mandarin. It is clearly the case in Shanghai, where Mandarin is quickly replacing Shanghainese as the language of everyday life.

The issue of languages remains a controversial topic, regardless of how many committees may have “solved” the problem and decided on standards. How the battle between Putonghua and local dialects will play out – whether it will completely dominate them or whether there will be further resurgences in their popularity – remains to be seen.

[^19]: More specifically, there were three major differences between the *guóyŭ* and the standard Beijing dialect at the time. These differences were (Chen 2004: 18): 
1 - Three voiced consonant initials \[v\]:, \[n\]:, and \[ŋ\]:, are retained for some characters, although they have either disappeared or become allophonic with other sounds in the Beijing dialect.
2 - Palatal initials before high front vowels in the Beijing dialect evolved from two distinct sources from Medieval Chinese, dental sibilants and velars. The former are called *jiān* ‘sharp’ initials, and the latter *tuán* ‘round’ initials. It was stipulated in the old national pronunciation that the initials that are derived from the sharp sounds should retain the previous pronunciation as dental sibilants, while those derived from the round sounds should become palatals. For example, in spite of the fact that there is no difference in pronunciation in the Beijing dialect between the corresponding characters in the two groups, *jīng* ‘refined’, *qīng* ‘blue, green’ and *xīng* ‘star’ are annotated differently in the old national pronunciation from *jīng* ‘warp’, *qīng* ‘light’, and *xīng* ‘mood’ (\[tsiŋ\]: \[tshiŋ\]: and \[siŋ\]: vs. \[tçiŋ\]: \[tçhiŋ\]: and \[çiŋ\]:) as the palatal initials in the first three words were derived from dental sibilants in Medieval Chinese. Although the *jiān/tuán* distinction is retained in some dialects, the two series of initials have completely merged in the Beijing dialect.
3 - The *rù* tone is treated as a toneme, which is supposed to have distinct phonetic manifestations, although characters belonging to this tonal group in Medieval Chinese no longer have any distinctive phonetic features in the Beijing dialect of the twentieth century.

  [^20]: Calls for complete abandonment of the character system in favor of Romanization were surprisingly common, as Simpson (2016: 94) points out. Even though the writing system had been such a key link among the different Chinese dialect groups and was “a highly visible symbol of the Chinese throughout their long imperial history”, it was actually criticized heavily for being “backward”, “clumsy”, “abominable”, and so on. This path was politically viable because at the time China was taking a utilitarian approach to progress; more importantly, though, was the fact that a long, shared cultural history *already existed*, as opposed to in instances (such as Italian) where a national language is used to unify peoples who do not share such cultural histories. In the end, Romanization never occurred due to internal (and later external, in the from of Japanese troops) turmoil. When the drive to modernize Chinese returned in the 1950s, support for Romanization was replaced with support for simplification of the script instead.

  [^22]: This decision came with the publication of a new dictionary featuring 12,219 characters and variants and a brand new phonetic system for clarifying their pronunciation called the *Glossary of Frequently Used Characters in National Pronunciation”* (*Guóyīn chángyòng zìhuì*).

  [^23]: For a large swath of the population – the native speakers of non-Mandarin dialects – however, the standard written language would remain distant from their everyday, spoken dialects.

  [^24]: Simpson 2016: 93

  [^25]: Between 1956 and 1964 over 2,500 simplified characters were introduced.

  [^26]: Originally, *pŭtо̄nghuà* had generally referred to substandard language, and in the 1930s had been used to identify dialects that diverged from the standard. At the conference in 1955 it was reassigned the meaning of “common”, thus making it essentially a synonym of *guóyŭ*. The idea was to avoid the word *guóyŭ*, as it seemed possibly too Han-centric to be used as a national standard, given that there were more than fifty officially recognized ethnic groups in China who speak over eighty different languages (Chen 2004: 25).

  [^27]: Simpson 96

  [^28]: According to the symposium, Putonghua was defined by its phonology, lexicon, and grammar as follows (Chen 2004: 24): "*Pŭtо̄nghuà* is the standard form of Modern Chinese with the Beijing phonological system as its norm of pronunciation, and Northern dialects as its base dialect, and looking to exemplary modern works in *báihuà* ‘vernacular literary language’ for its grammatical norms."

  [^29]: In fact, the goal of the committee was less to work out common pronunciations, as there was not much to discuss, and more to deal with borderline cases.

  [^30]: Of no surprise is the fact that Putonghua ability is significantly higher in Mandarin-speaking areas, given the similarity of Mandarin dialects and Putonghua. In non-Mandarin-speaking areas, Putonghua ability indicated education. For example, in a study conducted in mountainous regions where Southern Min dialects are spoken, all of those who have any proficiency in Putonghua have received formal education, while those who are only able to understand it but not speak it have received little to no education (Chen 2004: 30).

  [^35]: This vernacular writing continues unabated in Hong Kong and overseas, especially in the United States, where some 86% or so of Chinese Americans trace their origins back to Guangdong. As Chen (2004: 51) puts it, overseas, “to speak Chinese more often than not means the ability to speak Cantonese, rather than Northern Mandarin or other dialects.” With regards to Cantonese writing in mainland China, as well as the writing of other dialects, one of the major concerns with the suggestion to Romanize the script was that this would enable dialectal writing, something that since the Qing dynasty had been seen as a threat to unity (Simpson year: 96).
