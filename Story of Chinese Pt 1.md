*In Part 1 of this series on the fascinating story of how the Beijing dialect of Mandarin came to be known as "Chinese", or, in China, Putonghua, we weave our way from the origins of Chinese civilization and the first dynasties a few thousand years ago through up to the founding of the Republic of China in 1912. In [Part 2][https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=4], we will take a look at "Chinese" in the 20th century and today, and in [Part 3][https://lingyourlanguage.com/?article=3] we will return to our main questions: is Chinese one language? What do we mean when we say the "Chinese language"?*

Beijing, 1913. The Conference on Unification of Pronunciation has stagnated for months, with delegates from the Northern and Southern provinces unable to reach a compromise about how best to unify the Chinese Language. Passions were running high. The future of the Chinese language was at stake, and with it all the political, social, and economic ramifications. Passions ran so high, in fact, that when one delegate from a southern province said *wangbo ts’o*, his dialect’s word for “rickshaw”, one of the most prominent delegates from the north instead heard *wángba dàn*, or “son of a —” (translated literally ‘turtle’s egg’). The delegate from the north was chased out of the proceedings and never returned.[^1] 

But how exactly did the debate over the standardization of the Chinese language reach this point? There is currently a single, standard Chinese language – *pŭtо̄nghuà*, better known to the west as Mandarin – but what factors led to this dialect being considered the standard language? And while we’re at it, what do we mean by dialect, and what are the consequences of how we define that term? Let’s take a closer look at the path from Chinese in the time of Confucius to Chinese of the present day. We will see the results of the 1913 Conference on Unification of Pronunciation, how language policy has important political ramifications, and will try to answer a fundamental question: What is even meant by *the Chinese language*?

## A Brief History of Chinese
#### Yayan: A first lingua franca
Chinese civilization began around the Yellow River areas. By the time of the first dynasty we have archaeological evidence for (the Shang dynasty, ca. 1600 – 1046 BCE), there were already as many as 1,800 different clans and tribes speaking a variety of languages and dialects. The earliest Chinese *lingua franca*, or language used for communication between people speaking different languages, was based on the language spoken in (what is now known as) Yinxu, in the western part of the Henan province, the capital of the Shang dynasty.[^2]  

With the rise of the Zhou dynasty in the mid-11th century BCE, the different dialects around China really begin to diverge as the states in the feudal system went to war, conquered, and collapsed into each other. The importance of a lingua franca was quickly realized, and in the first half of the Zhou dynasty (the Western Zhou, ca. 1046-771 BCE), what is referred to as *yăyán* was a fully recognized, highly prestigious variety of Chinese used in a wide variety of educational, cultural, and official contexts. 

Yayan was based upon the language that had evolved from the lingua franca established during the Shang dynasty, and due to its location it was known as the Zhongzhou, or ‘Central China’, area dialect. This dialect was *so* prestigious,[^3]  in fact, that *even though* throughout its history China would disintegrate into many different states multiple times and would have to – again, multiple times – retreat to the south due to attacks from nomadic tribes to the north – despite all of this, **the Zhangzhou dialect more or less remained the lingua franca for about 2,000 years.**[^4] 

But where exactly did this prestige come from? 

First, the dialect was spoken in Luoyang and Kaifeng, two cities which served as the capital of many an imperial dynasty from the second half of the Zhou dynasty (the Eastern Zhou, 770-256 BCE) on, which helped guarantee its high prestige in society. 

In addition, we have [the beginning of the *kēyŭ*](https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf), or imperial examination system, in the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-618, 618-907 CE). This exam set the Zhongzhou dialect as the standard. Passing this exam qualified you for prestigious, official positions in the government, which made people want to learn the dialect even more. This resulted in more standardization of pronunciation as its influence spread across the country. 

More generally, the prestigious Han Chinese culture from the north exerted considerable influence over the non-Chinese people south of the Yangtze River, where little Chinese was spoken. By the time Chinese settlers arrived in the south in mid-3rd century BCE, though, many of the people had already adopted a lot of Chinese culture, and Chinese government policies only increased the pressure.[^5] The stage was set for introduction of the Zhongzhou dialect several centuries later in 317 CE when the Emperor Yuan of Jin moved his royal court south from Luoyang to Jiankang (present-day Nanjing). **This pressure would be the norm for the rest of the history of Chinese, as northern dialects continued (to this day) to exert a great influence on the southern dialects.** 

And so it was that Zhongzhou, the dialect of the ethnic Han Chinese people originally from the north, came to dominate the south as well.[^6]  Over the course of their 2,000-years as *the* standard dialect of China, the Zhongzhou dialect underwent a great deal of change. The system of writing had been standardized perhaps as early as the Qin dynasty (221 – 206 BCE).[^7]  During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) the divide between the written and spoken languages really began to develop, a divide that would only grow wider and wider over the course of the next millennia.[^8]  

In terms of the *spoken* language, however, the Zhongzhou dialect spoken in Luoyang was not *so* different from that spoken in Jianking for quite a while longer, at least through the Northern and Southern dynasties (420 – 589 CE).[^9]  After this point we begin to find more significant differences between the dialects.

#### The Rise of Mandarin

The Zhongzhou dialect was not the only dialect being spoken, though. By the late Tang dynasty at the turn of the 10th century CE, we are able to identify two major groups of Northern, Mandarin, dialects.[^10]  There was one spoken by northerners in the Yellow River region and Northeast China, and another spoken by people south of the Yangtze River and in Southeast China. A Mandarin dialect – the Beijing dialect – would come to replace Zhongzhou as standard spoken Chinese, but this process would take quite a bit more time still. In fact, as late as the Ming (1368 – 1644) and early Qing dynasties (1644-1912), the Beijing dialect was still seen as different from the standard pronunciation.[^11] 

There was one more step before the Beijing dialect became the standard. The Nanjing dialect of Mandarin became the standard at the beginning of the Ming dynasty. Letters from European missionaries paint a picture of Nanjing as the continuing cultural center of the country (in the letter, Nanjing is referred to as Nankin and Beijing as Pekin):

>In the judgement of the Chinese this city surpasses all other cities in the world in beauty and grandeur, and in this respect there are probably very few others superior or equal to it. It is literally filled with palaces and temples and bridges, and these are scarcely surpassed by similar structures in Europe…in the whole kingdom of China and in all bordering countries, Nankin is rated as the first city…and though the king changed his residence to Pekin in the north [in 1421], for the reasons already mentioned, Nankin lost none of its splendor or reputation.[^12] 

This increased the prestige of the dialect spoken in Nanjing, and the standard dialect continued to be associated with the spoken Mandarin of Nanjing for several hundred years.

It would take until the mid-19th century for the Beijing dialect to overtake the Nanjing as the prestige dialect and become the national standard. At the beginning of the 19th century it was still negatively associated with the Manchu governing class of the time. It had steadily been gaining interest over the years, though. Robert Morrison, author of the most important British grammar of Mandarin and the first bilingual dictionary, [documented]( https://archive.org/stream/p1dictionaryofch01morruoft#page/n19) that the Beijing dialect was on the way up and would probably take the Nanjing dialect’s place if the Manchu rulers remained in power. And that prediction would come true.

Beijing’s growing influence, both politically and culturally, might have been enough on its own to cement the Beijing dialect’s status, but there were other factors that helped it along. Following the Taiping rebellion of 1850 – 1864, Nanjing suffered a drastic loss of population. These factors led to a dramatic switch in the relative strength of the two dialects. 


#### A Turning Point

The year 1840 was a turning point in Chinese history. Up to this point, this idea of a “national standard” language hadn’t been as specific in the minds of the Chinese people as it is today.[^13]  However, with the devastating defeat to the British in the Opium War behind them, huge efforts to modernize the country began, and language reform – that is, unifying the Chinese language – was a key aspect of it. The linguist and scholar Zhu Wenxiong stated the importance of a unified Chinese in 1906:

> What I expect of my country’s people is for us to be able to stand on our own in this competitive world. It is impossible to achieve universal education if the writing system is not easy to use, and it is impossible to attain strong unity if there is no uniform national language.[^14]  

Inspired by Japan’s success in instituting a national standard language, several scholars proposed the idea of *guóyŭ* ‘national language.’ The most influential of these scholars was Wu Rulun, who was one of the first to openly argue for one unified language. His advocacy for this position later developed into the National Language Movement (*Guóyǔ yùndòng*), which would play an important role in the debate.

But the debate over what dialect the standard would be based on and how best to promote – as well as if there should even be a standard at all – became a heated political battle. 

On one side there were advocates of Guoyu, the National Language. They said that promoting local dialects would just divide the country, and what the country *really* needed was unity.

On the other side were intellectuals who argued that having separate standards for all of the dialects was the only moral solution. Having only one standard would mean that an entire section of the population would be faced with illiteracy and, effectively, second-class citizenship. Making Guoyu, the National Language, based on Guanhua (Mandarin) seemed like an openly biased decision against them. They argued that picking Mandarin as the basis for the dialect “smelled of Qing officialdom and all the bureaucratic excesses that that implied.” 

The response from advocates of Guoyu did not make the situation any better. The response was that the *guān* in *Guānhuà* didn’t mean “official”, as it usually did, but actually “public”, as in *guān-cèsuо̆* ‘public toilet’. If the opponents of Guanhua were really so against it because it was “official”, then by the same logic they’d also have to oppose public toilets. In the end, the opponents really had no alternatives to Guanhua, and the plans to implement a national standard pressed on.[^15] 

In 1911, at the very end of the Qing dynasty – the last imperial dynasty of China – the supporters of Guoyu won. The Ministry of Education passed the “Act of approaches to the unification of the national language” (*Tо̆ngyī *guóyŭ* fāngfàn*) at the Central Education Conference. It stated that any standardization of Guoyu would involve pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, that the standard should be based on Guanhua, in particular that spoken by educated people in Beijing. It would also have some elements from other dialects that were considered “elegant, correct, and popular.”[^16]  

## Notes

  [^1]: The full story of the proceedings of the 1913 Conference on Unification of Pronunciation is told beautifully by S. Robert Ramsey (1987) in *The Languages of China.*

  [^2]: Chen 2004: 7. The written form of this lingua franca was known as *jiăgŭwén.*

  [^3]: In the *Analects*, Confucius refers to *yăyán* as “elegant speech”, which is now agreed by scholars to refer to the standard spoken Chinese of the time (Ping 2004: 7).

  [^4]: In a way, the prestige of the Zhangzhou dialect was self-reinforcing. In the north, recently-formed non-Han states were quickly assimilating to Chinese culture and adopting the language due to its perceived prestige; in the south, elites from Luoyang moved to (what is now) Nanjing in a major migration during the Wei Jin period (220 – 589 CE) when Jin Yuandi (317-22 CE) brought his royal court to what is now Nanjing, and in so doing brought their dialect – and with it the prestige - and in this way spread it south of the Yangtze river. 

  [^5]: Such governmental policies include the order during the Qin dynasty for 500,000 military colonists to fill up newly-conquered territory (Ramsey 1987: 31)

  [^6]: All dialects of Chinese ultimately trace back to northern China geographically and middle Chinese linguistically, but in the southern dialects we find many archaic features that no longer exist in northern dialects. The more geographically-isolated southern Chinese communities spoke (and continue to speak) more conservative dialects, and we can find many traces of pre-Han south China in these dialects. For example, the further south one travels, the more tones one finds, probably as a result of tonal languages spoken before the Han arrived.
A more interesting example is given in Ramsey (1987: 36ff). In Standard Mandarin, *gо̄ngjī* ‘rooster’ contains two parts: *gо̄ng* ‘male’ + *jī* ‘chicken’. This is the usual pattern: a modifier comes before the word that it modifies. However, in southern dialects we often find the opposite. In Cantonese, for example, the word for rooster is *kaikong*, composed of *kai* ‘chicken’ + *kong* ‘male’. The elements of the words are the same, but the order of composition is reversed; this same phenomenon can be found in many other words. What is striking about this is that the southern dialects appear to reveal a Tai language family substrate, where this pattern of word construction is the norm. Ramsey presents other interesting examples of the possible effects of non-Sinitic substrata on southern dialects but concludes with the warning that we must remember that “the Southern dialects are not ‘mixed languages,’ they are Chinese”. 

  [^7]: Emperor Shi Huang Di’s (‘First Emperor’) is famous for the standardization of Chinese characters in an effort to introduce “common laws, weights and measures.” The standardized system was based off the highly-conservative standard of the far-western state of Qin. In the subsequent Han empire this system was codified in a dictionary, the *Shuо̄wēn Jiĕzì*. This system has been the basis of *kăishū*, the writing system, ever since (Ostler 2006: 138).

  [^8]: After the Han period, during the Eastern Jin (317 – 420 CE) as well as Northern and Southern dynasties (420 – 589 CE), a creolization occurred between Chinese and the Turkic, Mongolic, and Manchu language speakers who dominated the heartland of China. Significant changes included (but were not limited to) relexification, morphological restructuring, and phonological shifts (Mair 2010a: 23).

  [^9]: The *Qièyùn*, published in 601 CE, was one of the most influential rhyming dictionaries. Rhyming writing was an extremely important part of the *kēyŭ* – and played an important role in standardizing pronunciation. The *Qièyùn* is our best source for understanding the pronunciation of its time. It was repeatedly revised, annotated, and republished. Though there are disagreements about certain details, the consensus is that the standard of pronunciation it contains was the official standard, and that it is based on the Zhongzhou dialect, possibly with some features from other dialects, especially that of Nanjing.

  [^10]: The term “Mandarin” has several meanings. It was first used to refer to the standard language of educated people and officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties. This use of the term originates from European missionaries’ use of the term to translate the native Chinese term *guānhuà* ‘language of the officials, or mandarins.’ Writing in the mid-16th century, missionary Alessandro Vilignano wrote: “The Chinese have different languages in different provinces, to such an extent that they cannot understand each other…[they]: also have another language which is like a universal and common language; **this is the official language of the mandarins and of the court**; it is among them like Latin among ourselves…Two of our fathers have been learning this mandarin language…" (emphasis added). In linguistic and dialectological circles, Mandarin is used to refer to northern dialects called *bĕifāng fāngyán* or *guānhuà fāngyán*. In popular usage, however, Mandarin refers to modern standard Chinese, or *pŭtо̄nghuà*(Coblin 2000: 537).

  [^11]: Beijing pronunciation was known as *bĕiyīn* ‘Northern pronunciation’, while the standard pronuniciation went by a variety of names such as *guānhuà* ‘Mandarin’, *zhèngyīn* ‘standard pronunciaton’, *Hànyīn* ‘Han pronunciation’, *guānyīn* ‘official pronunciation’, or even *tо̄ngyīn* ‘general pronunciation’.

  [^12]: Quoted in Coblin 1997: 285

  [^13]: In *Modern Chinese: History and Sociolinguistics*, Ping Chen describes it as “more of an attitudinal stance on what was supposed to be the standard language in polite society…rather than a reference to a specific speech form that was clearly defined, effectively promoted, conscientiously learned, and extensively used.”

  [^14]: Chen (2004: 14), from Ni Haishu (1959) *Qīngmò Hànyŭ pīnyīn yùndòng biānniánshĭ*.

  [^16]: More specifically, the conclusions of the conference were that (Chen 2004: 15-16): 
  1 - A *Guóyŭ Diàochá Zо̆nghuì* ‘General Committee for the Survey of the National Language’ will be set up in Beijing, with branches set up in all provinces. It will conduct a survey of dialects with respect to vocabulary, grammar, phonology, and other related aspects.
2 - On the basis of the results of the survey in all provinces, the General Committee is to decide on the standards of *guóyŭ* by selecting what is elegant, correct, and popular with regard to vocabulary, grammar, and phonology. Textbooks and dictionaries of *guóyŭ* will be compiled in conformity with the standard.
 3 - A standard of pronunciation will be determined. It will be mainly based upon the Beijing dialect. The *rù* ‘entering’ tone, however, should be preserved. The vocabulary and grammar should be mainly based upon *guānhuà*, and meet the criteria of being correct, elegant, and logical.
4 - A standard phonetic alphabet should be decided on.
5 - *Guóyŭ* Instruction Schools will be set up by the Ministry of Education, which will train students from provinces. Graduates will return to their respective provinces to train more teachers. Teaching staff in schools and colleges who cannot speak *guóyŭ* must receive training in these schools. Apart from being taught as a specific subject, *guóyŭ* should gradually become the medium of instruction for all subjects
