# The Story of Chinese
### Part 3: What do we mean by the "Chinese language"?

By Raphael Fabisiewicz

*In the final part of this series on the history of the "Chinese language", we return to ourguiding questions from Part 1: is Chinese one language? What do we mean when we say the "Chinese language"? In Part 1, we saw how the Beijing dialect of Mandarin came to be known as "Chinese", and in Part 2 we saw the evolution of Chinese through the 20th century up to the present day.*

***

We posed two questions at the beginning of this journey. We have now answered the first: We saw where Chinese began, how the different dialects rose and fell, gained prestige and lost prestige, how the 20th century debate over which dialect should form the basis for a unified Chinese language became such an important part of China’s efforts at modernizations, and how all of these factors led to Putonghua being the single, official standard.

Now, let’s take a look at our second question: **What exactly do we mean by the “Chinese language”?**

Chinese is traditionally divided into seven major dialects, with Mandarin being the one northern dialect and the other six being southern dialects:

| |Variety| English| Number of Speakers[^36] |
|---|------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Northern|*Guānhuà*     | Mandarin|1,074,000,000| 
|Southern|*Wú yŭ*     | Wu| 80,797,910|   
| |*Xiāng yŭ*     | Xiang |36,900,000|
| |*Gàn yŭ*     |Gan|21,900,000|
| |*Kèjiā huà*     | Keija; Hakka|48,458,500|
| |*Mĭn yŭ*     | Min | 50,184,500|
| |*Yuè yŭ*     |Yue (Cantonese)|73,757,610|

This is all well and good, but we immediately run into a problem. In theory, the term “dialect” is a translation of the *fāngyán*. But here we find one instance of a [mistranslation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/opinion/sunday/why-mistranslation-matters.html) that has caused some serious misconceptions.

In reality, *fāngyán* literally means “speech of a place.” It is obvious that “dialect” is not the right translation: the term has been used to describe not only the different varieties of Chinese but also languages as unrelated as Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and has even been applied to western languages at times. 

The discussion of whether Chinese is composed of various *dialects*, then, is misinformed from the very start. Some scholars have proposed new translations that can capture the ambiguity present in the term *fāngyán*.  One suggestion is “topolect”, though the disadvantage of this term is it doesn’t fit neatly into the systems of language classification established in Western linguistics.[^37]  As discussed in [our article on the difference between a language and a dialect](link to “What’s in a Language?”), the term “variety” is oftentimes a good substitute for “dialect”, in that it is a simple, descriptive label for different linguistic entities.

But what if we go not by traditional Chinese classification schemes, but rather by mutual intelligibility? By this standard, we’d have an enormous quantity of “Chinese languages” *plural*[^38] – an idea that goes against common conceptions of Chinese. And not just uninformed misconceptions of Chinese by speakers of other languages, such as that all speakers of Chinese languages can understand each other (they can’t), or that they can at least understand each other through writing, since all dialects share a writing system (they can't and they don’t).[^39]   

This standard also goes against conceptions held by the Chinese themselves. 

According to Western linguistic categorization, we should call Chinese (or the *Sinitic* languages) a language *group*, just how the Romance languages, for example, form a group. What we usually call dialects would be branches within that group, each with a multitude of dialects and accents. 

The comparison of Sinitic languages with Romance languages ends here, though. A speaker of Italian who is learning French would consider themselves to be learning a new language, but when a speaker of one variety of Chinese learns another variety they generally do not feel that they are learning a new *language* so much as a new variety of “Chinese.”[^40]  In The Languages of China, S. Robert Ramsey summarizes the attitude succinctly:

>The Chinese believe that they speak dialects of a single language not because they are unaware of  the objective linguistic facts, but because of certain cultural considerations…the Chinese language is spoken *by a single group of people with a common cultural heritage.* China is not only the most populous country on earth, it is also the oldest social institution, and the Chinese people belong to and follow cultural and national traditions that have continued since the days of the Han Empire and before. **They feel themselves to be part of the same language community in ways that the Romance peoples, with their separate histories, cultures, and language norms, could never do.** In the definition of what Chinese is, these are not insignificant considerations. The Han people coalesce as a nation and therefore speak one language; the Romance peoples are several nations and therefore speak several languages.[^41] 

The answer, then, generally speaking, is that when we say “Chinese”, we are referring to (Modern Standard) Mandarin. As should be clear now though, it makes more sense to just call it Mandarin rather than “Chinese”. It is more precise, and doesn’t just lump together all of the varieties under the overly vague term “Chinese.” Calling Mandarin only “Chinese” makes as much sense as calling Hindi “Indian”. However, like the term “dialect”, it looks like the name “Chinese” is here to stay, as an imperfect but common name for Mandarin.

There are endless avenues of interest that could have been pursued in more detail (and we hope that you will check out the notes for some more details), and endless directions that the story of Chinese might continue. For now, we will just have to see how it all plays out.

  [^39]: Written Chinese has always been either *wényán*, which was based upon Old Chinese, or Mandarin. That means that anyone educated in writing could only have written in either of those two language, but *never in their own topolect.* Thus they (and the person with whom they are communicating) would have to know one of those two languages in order to communicate with someone else speaking a mutually unintelligible topolect. In other words, it is a myth that all Chinese dialects share the same written language. Furthermore, in the case of different dialects being written in Romanized form or other systems, the differences between the dialects would make it impossible for a reader of one dialect to understand what was written in another. 

  [^40]: Ramsey (1987: 16) comments that the general method for a speaker of one variety of Chinese to learn another variety is not really a formal process. Rather, it is just “picking up” the new variety through contact with others and through learning a few general rules about pronunciations that are different from what they are used to.

  [^41]: Ramsey 1987: 16. Mair (1991: 11) argues, however, that the term “Chinese language” – usually referring to (Modern Standard) Mandarin – as such is problematic, as *the Chinese people do not call their own language “Chinese.”* When Indians call their language Hindi, we refer to the language as Hindi, and so too we should follow the Chinese in calling the language Mandarin, which actually is an accurate translation of the term it is supposed to represent, *guānhuà.*
