*In this article, we take a look at the fascinating story of how the Beijing dialect of Mandarin came to be known as "Chinese", or, in China, Putonghua. We weave our way from the origins of Chinese civilization and the first dynasties a few thousand years ago through to the modern People's Republic of China. We'll see how the prestige of different dialects rose and fell, how governments handled the language issue, and what the situation is like today.*

Beijing, 1913. The Conference on Unification of Pronunciation has stagnated for months, with delegates from the Northern and Southern provinces unable to reach a compromise about how best to unify the Chinese Language. Passions were running high. The future of the Chinese language was at stake, and with it all the political, social, and economic ramifications. Passions ran so high, in fact, that when one delegate from a southern province said *wangbo ts’o*, his dialect’s word for “rickshaw”, one of the most prominent delegates from the north instead heard *wángba dàn*, or “son of a —” (translated literally ‘turtle’s egg’). The delegate from the north was chased out of the proceedings and never returned.[^1] 

But how exactly did the debate over the standardization of the Chinese language reach this point? There is currently a single, standard Chinese language – *pŭtо̄nghuà*, better known to the west as Mandarin – but what factors led to this dialect being considered the standard language? And while we’re at it, what do we mean by dialect, and what are the consequences of how we define that term? Let’s take a closer look at the path from Chinese in the time of Confucius to Chinese of the present day. We will see the results of the 1913 Conference on Unification of Pronunciation, how language policy has important political ramifications, and will try to answer a fundamental question: What is even meant by *the Chinese language*?

## A Brief History of Chinese
#### Yayan: A first lingua franca
Chinese civilization began around the Yellow River areas. By the time of the first dynasty we have archaeological evidence for (the Shang dynasty, ca. 1600 – 1046 BCE), there were already as many as 1,800 different clans and tribes speaking a variety of languages and dialects. The earliest Chinese *lingua franca*, or language used for communication between people speaking different languages, was based on the language spoken in (what is now known as) Yinxu, in the western part of the Henan province, the capital of the Shang dynasty.[^2]  

With the rise of the Zhou dynasty in the mid-11th century BCE, the different dialects around China really begin to diverge as the states in the feudal system went to war, conquered, and collapsed into each other. The importance of a lingua franca was quickly realized, and in the first half of the Zhou dynasty (the Western Zhou, ca. 1046-771 BCE), what is referred to as *yăyán* was a fully recognized, highly prestigious variety of Chinese used in a wide variety of educational, cultural, and official contexts. 

Yayan was based upon the language that had evolved from the lingua franca established during the Shang dynasty, and due to its location it was known as the Zhongzhou, or ‘Central China’, area dialect. This dialect was *so* prestigious,[^3]  in fact, that *even though* throughout its history China would disintegrate into many different states multiple times and would have to – again, multiple times – retreat to the south due to attacks from nomadic tribes to the north – despite all of this, **the Zhangzhou dialect more or less remained the lingua franca for about 2,000 years.** [^4] 

But where exactly did this prestige come from? 

First, the dialect was spoken in Luoyang and Kaifeng, two cities which served as the capital of many an imperial dynasty from the second half of the Zhou dynasty (the Eastern Zhou, 770-256 BCE) on, which helped guarantee its high prestige in society. 

In addition, we have [the beginning of the *kēyŭ*](https://www.princeton.edu/~elman/documents/Civil%20Service%20Examinations.pdf), or imperial examination system, in the Sui and Tang dynasties (581-618, 618-907 CE). This exam set the Zhongzhou dialect as the standard. Passing this exam qualified you for prestigious, official positions in the government, which made people want to learn the dialect even more. This resulted in more standardization of pronunciation as its influence spread across the country. 

More generally, the prestigious Han Chinese culture from the north exerted considerable influence over the non-Chinese people south of the Yangtze River, where little Chinese was spoken. By the time Chinese settlers arrived in the south in mid-3rd century BCE, though, many of the people had already adopted a lot of Chinese culture, and Chinese government policies only increased the pressure.[^5] The stage was set for introduction of the Zhongzhou dialect several centuries later in 317 CE when the Emperor Yuan of Jin moved his royal court south from Luoyang to Jiankang (present-day Nanjing). **This pressure would be the norm for the rest of the history of Chinese, as northern dialects continued (to this day) to exert a great influence on the southern dialects.** 

And so it was that Zhongzhou, the dialect of the ethnic Han Chinese people originally from the north,[^6] came to dominate the south as well.[^7] Over the course of their 2,000-years as *the* standard dialect of China, the Zhongzhou dialect underwent a great deal of change. The system of writing had been standardized perhaps as early as the Qin dynasty (221 – 206 BCE).[^8]  During the Han dynasty (206 BCE – 220 CE) the divide between the written and spoken languages really began to develop, a divide that would only grow wider and wider over the course of the next millennia.[^9]  

In terms of the *spoken* language, however, the Zhongzhou dialect spoken in Luoyang was not *so* different from that spoken in Jianking for quite a while longer, at least through the Northern and Southern dynasties (420 – 589 CE).[^10]  After this point we begin to find more significant differences between the dialects.

#### The Rise of Mandarin

The Zhongzhou dialect was not the only dialect being spoken, though. By the late Tang dynasty at the turn of the 10th century CE, we are able to identify two major groups of Northern, Mandarin, dialects.[^11]  There was one spoken by northerners in the Yellow River region and Northeast China, and another spoken by people south of the Yangtze River and in Southeast China. A Mandarin dialect – the Beijing dialect – would come to replace Zhongzhou as standard spoken Chinese, but this process would take quite a bit more time still. In fact, as late as the Ming (1368 – 1644) and early Qing dynasties (1644-1912), the Beijing dialect was still seen as different from the standard pronunciation.[^12] 

There was one more step before the Beijing dialect became the standard. The Nanjing dialect of Mandarin became the standard at the beginning of the Ming dynasty. Letters from European missionaries paint a picture of Nanjing as the continuing cultural center of the country (in the letter, Nanjing is referred to as Nankin and Beijing as Pekin):

>In the judgement of the Chinese this city surpasses all other cities in the world in beauty and grandeur, and in this respect there are probably very few others superior or equal to it. It is literally filled with palaces and temples and bridges, and these are scarcely surpassed by similar structures in Europe…in the whole kingdom of China and in all bordering countries, Nankin is rated as the first city…and though the king changed his residence to Pekin in the north [in 1421], for the reasons already mentioned, Nankin lost none of its splendor or reputation.[^13] 

This increased the prestige of the dialect spoken in Nanjing, and the standard dialect continued to be associated with the spoken Mandarin of Nanjing for several hundred years.

It would take until the mid-19th century for the Beijing dialect to overtake the Nanjing as the prestige dialect and become the national standard. At the beginning of the 19th century it was still negatively associated with the Manchu governing class of the time. It had steadily been gaining interest over the years, though. Robert Morrison, author of the most important British grammar of Mandarin and the first bilingual dictionary, [documented]( https://archive.org/stream/p1dictionaryofch01morruoft#page/n19) that the Beijing dialect was on the way up and would probably take the Nanjing dialect’s place if the Manchu rulers remained in power. And that prediction would come true.

Beijing’s growing influence, both politically and culturally, might have been enough on its own to cement the Beijing dialect’s status, but there were other factors that helped it along. Following the Taiping rebellion of 1850 – 1864, Nanjing suffered a drastic loss of population. These factors led to a dramatic switch in the relative strength of the two dialects. 


#### A Turning Point

The year 1840 was a turning point in Chinese history. Up to this point, this idea of a “national standard” language hadn’t been as specific in the minds of the Chinese people as it is today.[^14]  However, with the devastating defeat to the British in the Opium War behind them, huge efforts to modernize the country began, and language reform – that is, unifying the Chinese language – was a key aspect of it. The linguist and scholar Zhu Wenxiong stated the importance of a unified Chinese in 1906:

> What I expect of my country’s people is for us to be able to stand on our own in this competitive world. It is impossible to achieve universal education if the writing system is not easy to use, and it is impossible to attain strong unity if there is no uniform national language.[^15]  

Inspired by Japan’s success in instituting a national standard language, several scholars proposed the idea of *guóyŭ* ‘national language.’ The most influential of these scholars was Wu Rulun, who was one of the first to openly argue for one unified language. His advocacy for this position later developed into the National Language Movement (*Guóyǔ yùndòng*), which would play an important role in the debate.

But the debate over what dialect the standard would be based on and how best to promote – as well as if there should even be a standard at all – became a heated political battle. 

On one side there were advocates of Guoyu, the National Language. They said that promoting local dialects would just divide the country, and what the country *really* needed was unity.

On the other side were intellectuals who argued that having separate standards for all of the dialects was the only moral solution. Having only one standard would mean that an entire section of the population would be faced with illiteracy and, effectively, second-class citizenship. Making Guoyu, the National Language, based on Guanhua (Mandarin) seemed like an openly biased decision against them. They argued that picking Mandarin as the basis for the dialect “smelled of Qing officialdom and all the bureaucratic excesses that that implied.” 

The response from advocates of Guoyu did not make the situation any better. The response was that the *guān* in *Guānhuà* didn’t mean “official”, as it usually did, but actually “public”, as in *guān-cèsuо̆* ‘public toilet’. If the opponents of Guanhua were really so against it because it was “official”, then by the same logic they’d also have to oppose public toilets. In the end, the opponents really had no alternatives to Guanhua, and the plans to implement a national standard pressed on.[^16] 

In 1911, at the very end of the Qing dynasty – the last imperial dynasty of China – the supporters of Guoyu won. The Ministry of Education passed the “Act of approaches to the unification of the national language” (*Tо̆ngyī *guóyŭ* fāngfàn*) at the Central Education Conference. It stated that any standardization of Guoyu would involve pronunciation, vocabulary, and grammar, that the standard should be based on Guanhua, in particular that spoken by educated people in Beijing. It would also have some elements from other dialects that were considered “elegant, correct, and popular.”[^17],[^18],[^19],[^20]


#### Chinese in the Republic of China

With the founding of the Republic of China in 1912 came increased enthusiasm to put into motion the steps agreed upon in 1911. And what better way to do so than the Commission for Unifying Reading Pronunciation (*Dúyīn Tо̆ngyī Huì*)? The Ministry of Education called experts and other qualified people, and when all 80 people arrived in February 1933, they were ready to start.  They had three key questions to answer:

1.	How should the characters be pronounced?
2.	What would the sounds of the language be?
3.	How would those sounds be written down phonetically?

The conference was full of naïve arguments with absolutely no linguistic foundation – but which were not lacking in passion. One such argument was that “Germany is strong because its language contains many voiced sounds and China is weak because Mandarin lacks them.”[^21]  Months went by with no progress. 

It's not hard to see why they had such trouble picking a standard: the “Chinese language” was really an extremely diverse group of languages. Though not a perfect analogy by any means, it was as if the European nations had gotten together to decide on some **one** Romance language to replace Latin. 

Eventually, Wang Zhao, the leader of the Mandarin dialect delegates, proposed a one-province-one-vote system. The Mandarin delegation obviously stood to benefit with this, because there were simply more Mandarin-speaking delegates at the conference than speakers of other dialects. No one was fooled by this suggestion. Tempers rose, leading to such events as the incident between Zhao and Wang Rongbao, leader of the southern delegation, where Rongbao was chased out after being misheard.[^22] 

The commission powered through, and after three month’s work on debating and making decisions - which included going through the pronunciation of about 6,500 characters individually – they achieved their standardization goals. The pronunciation they decided on, which was later known as “Old National Pronunciation” (*Lăo guóyīn*), did not actually match how *anyone* spoke. Instead, it was an artificial mix of Beijing Mandarin with features from other dialects.[^23],[^24],[^26],[^26] 

Due to political instability, it would not be until 1919 that the Dictionary of National Pronunciation (*Guóyīn zìdiăn*) produced by the delegates in 1913 would be released. In 1920 the Ministry of Education decreed that this new, standardized Guoyu would be promoted across the country as *the* standard, and that *baíhuà*, a writing system that had been in place since the Tang dynasty (618 – 907 CE), would become the language of literacy.[^27]  This meant that students would be taught in Guoyu, as opposed to *guówen* (the “national written language”). 

**This was a radical shift from the previous method of teaching,** which had students learning to read and write in a style based upon Old Chinese. Now, rather than focusing on a system of reading and writing that had crystallized long ago, students would be working on their modern, spoken Chinese.

There was just one problem: no one actually was quite sure how to pronounce everything – in fact, most people weren’t even able to. Beijing and other natives of northern China had trouble with features that didn’t exist in their dialects anymore, and southerners were essentially being told to learn a new language. One scholar, Wang Pu, released recordings of the dictionary to help, but he ran into a big problem: not even *he* was able to pronounce the sounds without a noticeable Beijing accent. Another scholar, the American-trained linguist Yuen Ren Chao, took over and produced a new set of recordings and even taught others with them, but he too ran into a problem: he was the only one really able to teach the pronunciations![^28] 

This left the National Language Movement in a bit of a pickle. People began to doubt the national standard. Should there – or even could there – be any standardized pronunciation? 

Two camps emerged, one in favor of the standard at the time, one in favor of a new standard. Those in favor of the current standard became the *guóyīn* ‘national pronunciation’ school. Those who favored a new one became the *Jīngyīn* ‘Beijing pronunciation’ school, because they argued that the national standard should be based on the Beijing dialect *without* the added features. Yet another committee was convened – and several times, at that – this time the 1923 Preparatory Committee for the Unification of the National Language (*guóyŭ Tо̄ngyī Chóubèihuì*). In the end they sided with the Beijing pronunciation school and repealed the Old Pronunciation in favor of a New National Pronunciation (*Xīn guóyīn*) based entirely on the Beijing dialect.[^29]  

**This was a huge step in the history of standard spoken Chinese.** 

For all of Chinese history up to this point, more attention had always been paid to *literary pronunciations* of words, rather than to how people *actually* pronounced words in their day-to-day lives. With the New National Pronunciation, that had all changed: now, for the first time ever, the spoken version was taking precedent over the literary.[^30] 

#### Chinese in the People’s Republic of China

1949 saw the founding of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), and with it, another wave of enthusiasm for language reform – and yes, more committees and conferences and commissions. The PRC was different than earlier governments. It saw a standardized, common national language as an opportunity to help solve socioeconomic inequalities and help unify the nation as a whole. They argued that only when the population could communicate with each other effectively and have easier linguistic access to education, would they start to feel united as a single nation.[^31] 

To this end they played a much more active role in all of this language reform business, and after five years of planning they organized two major conferences with the goal of solving the same issues as always: What should the standards be for Modern Spoken Chinese and Modern Written Chinese? In addition, they wanted to design yet another new system, but this time to go along with a brand new set of simplified characters.[^32] 

The first conference, in October 1955, was the National Conference on Script Reform (*Quánguó Wénzì Găigé Huìyì*). At this conference, experts passed a resolution defining a new, standard form of Chinese called *pŭtо̄nghuà* ‘common language’, based upon northern dialects with Beijing pronunciation.[^33]  The choice of a northern Mandarin dialect as the basis for Putonghua was not meant to reflect bias in favor of the north (as perhaps it did 20 years earlier), but rather the practical consideration that a significant majority of the population already spoke it.[^34]  At the second conference, in February 1956, the Symposium on the Standardization of Modern Chinese (*Xiàndài Hànyŭ Guīfànhuà Xuéshù Huìyì*), that definition was solidified.[^35]  

Deciding how everything should be pronounced was a lot easier this time, since the pronunciation actually matched how real people spoke. A committee made quick work of the task and published their results in two dictionaries, the New China Dictionary (*Xīnhuá zìdiăn*) and the Modern Chinese Dictionary (*Xiàndài Hànyŭ cídiăn*).[^36] 

The government really invested in this new standard. There were nationwide promotional campaigns and pamphlets explaining the similarities and differences between Putonghua and local dialects. There were committees set up at the provincial and major city levels to get the transition to Putonghua started as quickly and efficiently as possible and workshops to train qualified instructors who could spread it throughout the provinces. Putonghua became the language of schools and of mass media, and everyone was encouraged to learn and use it at work. The 1958 introduction of *Hànyŭ pīnyīn*, the new phonetic system, only increased Putonghua’s reach, especially into southern areas.

The promotion of Putonghua was similar to other mass movements in China since the founding of the PRC in many ways. It began with lots of publicity and calls for popular support from high-ranking government officials, had national conferences to set agendas and come up with appropriate solutions, and ended with the implementation of the solutions by means of mass media and government agencies. 

That is not to say that everything went perfectly. As with other mass movements, excitement dropped quickly as attention turned to other important issues of the time, and so in the 1960s and 70s little attention was paid to the issue of language reform. Only after the Cultural Revolution from 1966-76 did the promotion of Putonghua resume, with the government including an article (19) in the [1982 constitution](https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/China_2004?lang=en) that stated that Putonghua would be promoted across the country. Even still, there was less enthusiasm than there had been earlier in the 20th century.

#### Chinese Today

By and large, the implementation of Putonghua was a huge success. By 1984, 90% of the Chinese population could understand it, and 50% communicate. Compare this to just 30 years prior, when only 41% understood it.[^37]  It has had remarkable success in regions where a wide variety of dialects are spoken, as it provides for a convenient, useful, and high-prestige lingua franca. On the other hand, in regions that either do not have much linguistic diversity, or that already have a highly prestigious dialect, Putonghua is not as readily taken up by the population.  Putonghua is seen as a marker of status, of educational attainment. 

In a bilingual society, there is usually one language or dialect considered the *high variety* and one cosnidered the *low variety*. Each is associated with certain functions, contexts, attitudes, and values. The high variety is used for written literature, for official functions, education, and so on. The low variety is considered informal, better suited for use among friends and family or in private.  

Putonghua is clearly the high variety in modern-day China, and it has reached this level for the political, cultural, and economic reasons explored above. It is such a force to be reckoned with that other dialects, such as Min, Wu, and Xiang, are moving towards it in terms of their phonology, vocabulary, and even grammatical features. It is being used more and more in informal settings, demonstrating just how much it has become a part of everyday life for a huge segment of the population.[^38]

All of this is not to say that Putonghua goes unchallenged in China, and that the only debates are about the right way to write it and the right name to call it. Pockets of resistance have sprung up across the country, some bigger than others, fighting for recognition of local dialects in a variety of contexts.

Take Cantonese, the biggest pocket of resistance. Cantonese has been highly prestigious at least since the Ming dynasty, with its popularity reflecting the economic success of the Cantonese-speaking area, especially since the 1980s.[^39] It’s also the largest of the Yue dialects, spoken by 4-5% of China’s 1.3 billion people – about 60 million people – primarily in Guangzhou, Hong Kong, and by up to 11 million outside of China, especially in the United States.[^40]  

Cantonese speakers form arguably the most well-defined sub-group of the Han Chinese, with a highly developed sense of group identity – Cantonese speakers will identify themselves as “Cantonese” and see their dialect as standard – an independent language.[^41]  One way this can be seen is in their literature. Cantonese is the *only* dialect besides Mandarin to have a rich literature, though this writing, as with writing in other dialects, is often suppressed in mainland China.[^42]  

But there are the other, smaller pockets of resistance as well. [In June 2018](https://qz.com/1314432/a-debate-over-the-word-for-grandmother-in-shanghai-schools-exposes-a-linguistic-and-political-rift-in-china/), photos of some elementary school textbooks in Shanghai started to be shared more and more on the social network Weibo. These textbooks had the word lăo lao for “grandmother” – the Potanghua term – rather than wài pó, the Shanghainese (Wu dialect) word. The reasons for the heated debates of the 20th century and earlier over which dialect to make standard are still at play today: speakers of non-Mandarin dialects often feel under attack by the seemingly unstoppable force of Mandarin. It is clearly the case in Shanghai, where Mandarin is quickly replacing Shanghainese as the language of everyday life.

The issue of languages remains a controversial topic, regardless of how many committees may have “solved” the problem and decided on standards. How the battle between Putonghua and local dialects will play out – whether it will completely dominate them or whether there will be further resurgences in their popularity – remains to be seen.

### A note on the term “Chinese language.”
We posed two questions at the beginning of this journey. We have now answered the first: We saw where Chinese began, how the different dialects rose and fell, gained prestige and lost prestige, how the 20th century debate over which dialect should form the basis for a unified Chinese language became such an important part of China’s efforts at modernizations, and how all of these factors led to Putonghua being the single, official standard.

Now, let’s take a look at our second question: **What exactly do we mean by the “Chinese language”?**

Chinese is traditionally divided into seven major dialects, with Mandarin being the one northern dialect and the other six being southern dialects:

| |Variety| English| Number of Speakers[^43] |
|---|------------- |-------------|-------------|
|Northern|*Guānhuà*     | Mandarin|1,074,000,000| 
|Southern|*Wú yŭ*     | Wu| 80,797,910|   
| |*Xiāng yŭ*     | Xiang |36,900,000|
| |*Gàn yŭ*     |Gan|21,900,000|
| |*Kèjiā huà*     | Keija; Hakka|48,458,500|
| |*Mĭn yŭ*     | Min | 50,184,500|
| |*Yuè yŭ*     |Yue (Cantonese)|73,757,610|
*Varieties of Sinitic languages*

This is all well and good, but we immediately run into a problem. In theory, the term “dialect” is a translation of the *fāngyán*. But here we find one instance of a [mistranslation](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/28/opinion/sunday/why-mistranslation-matters.html) that has caused some serious misconceptions.

In reality, *fāngyán* literally means “speech of a place.” It is obvious that “dialect” is not the right translation: the term has been used to describe not only the different varieties of Chinese but also languages as unrelated as Japanese, Korean, Vietnamese, Mongolian, and has even been applied to western languages at times. 

The discussion of whether Chinese is composed of various *dialects*, then, is misinformed from the very start. Some scholars have proposed new translations that can capture the ambiguity present in the term *fāngyán*.  One suggestion is “topolect”, though the disadvantage of this term is it doesn’t fit neatly into the systems of language classification established in Western linguistics.[^44]  As discussed in [our article on the difference between a language and a dialect](link to “What’s in a Language?”), the term “variety” is oftentimes a good substitute for “dialect”, in that it is a simple, descriptive label for different linguistic entities.

But what if we go not by traditional Chinese classification schemes, but rather by mutual intelligibility? By this standard, we’d have an enormous quantity of “Chinese languages” *plural*[^45] – an idea that goes against common conceptions of Chinese. And not just uninformed misconceptions of Chinese by speakers of other languages, such as that all speakers of Chinese languages can understand each other (they can’t), or that they can at least understand each other through writing, since all dialects share a writing system (they can't and they don’t).[^46]   

This standard also goes against conceptions held by the Chinese themselves. 

According to Western linguistic categorization, we should call Chinese (or the *Sinitic* languages) a language *group*, just how the Romance languages, for example, form a group. What we usually call dialects would be branches within that group, each with a multitude of dialects and accents. 

The comparison of Sinitic languages with Romance languages ends here, though. A speaker of Italian who is learning French would consider themselves to be learning a new language, but when a speaker of one variety of Chinese learns another variety they generally do not feel that they are learning a new *language* so much as a new variety of “Chinese.”[^47]  In The Languages of China, S. Robert Ramsey summarizes the attitude succinctly:

>The Chinese believe that they speak dialects of a single language not because they are unaware of  the objective linguistic facts, but because of certain cultural considerations…the Chinese language is spoken *by a single group of people with a common cultural heritage.* China is not only the most populous country on earth, it is also the oldest social institution, and the Chinese people belong to and follow cultural and national traditions that have continued since the days of the Han Empire and before. **They feel themselves to be part of the same language community in ways that the Romance peoples, with their separate histories, cultures, and language norms, could never do.** In the definition of what Chinese is, these are not insignificant considerations. The Han people coalesce as a nation and therefore speak one language; the Romance peoples are several nations and therefore speak several languages.[^48] 

The answer, then, generally speaking, is that when we say “Chinese”, we are referring to (Modern Standard) Mandarin. As should be clear now though, it makes more sense to just call it Mandarin rather than “Chinese”. It is more precise, and doesn’t just lump together all of the varieties under the overly vague term “Chinese.” Calling Mandarin only “Chinese” makes as much sense as calling Hindi “Indian”. However, like the term “dialect”, it looks like the name “Chinese” is here to stay, as an imperfect but common name for Mandarin.

There are endless avenues of interest that could have been pursued in more detail (and we hope that you will check out the notes for some more details), and endless directions that the story of Chinese might continue. For now, we will just have to see how it all plays out.

[^2]: Chen 2004: 7. The written form of this lingua franca was known as *jiăgŭwén.*

[^3]: In the *Analects*, Confucius refers to *yăyán* as “elegant speech”, which is now agreed by scholars to refer to the standard spoken Chinese of the time (Ping 2004: 7).

[^4]: In a way, the prestige of the Zhangzhou dialect was self-reinforcing. In the north, recently-formed non-Han states were quickly assimilating to Chinese culture and adopting the language due to its perceived prestige; in the south, elites from Luoyang moved to (what is now) Nanjing in a major migration during the Wei Jin period (220 – 589 CE) when Jin Yuandi (317-22 CE) brought his royal court to what is now Nanjing, and in so doing brought their dialect – and with it the prestige - and in this way spread it south of the Yangtze river. 

[^5]: Such governmental policies include the order during the Qin dynasty for 500,000 military colonists to fill up newly-conquered territory (Ramsey 1987: 31)

[^6]: All dialects of Chinese ultimately trace back to northern China geographically and middle Chinese linguistically, but in the southern dialects we find many archaic features that no longer exist in northern dialects. The more geographically-isolated southern Chinese communities spoke (and continue to speak) more conservative dialects, and we can find many traces of pre-Han south China in these dialects. For example, the further south one travels, the more tones one finds, probably as a result of tonal languages spoken before the Han arrived. 
  
  [^7]: An interesting example of the phenomenon in Note 6 is given in Ramsey (1987: 36ff). In Standard Mandarin, *gо̄ngjī* ‘rooster’ contains two parts: *gо̄ng* ‘male’ + *jī* ‘chicken’. This is the usual pattern: a modifier comes before the word that it modifies. However, in southern dialects we often find the opposite. In Cantonese, for example, the word for rooster is *kaikong*, composed of *kai* ‘chicken’ + *kong* ‘male’. The elements of the words are the same, but the order of composition is reversed. Southern dialects appear to reveal a Tai language family substrate, where this pattern of word construction is the norm. Ramsey concludes with the warning that we must remember that “the Southern dialects are not ‘mixed languages,’ they are Chinese”. 

  [^8]: Emperor Shi Huang Di’s (‘First Emperor’) is famous for the standardization of Chinese characters in an effort to introduce “common laws, weights and measures.” The standardized system was based off the highly-conservative standard of the far-western state of Qin. In the subsequent Han empire this system was codified in a dictionary, the *Shuо̄wēn Jiĕzì*. This system has been the basis of *kăishū*, the writing system, ever since (Ostler 2006: 138).

  [^9]: After the Han period, during the Eastern Jin (317 – 420 CE) as well as Northern and Southern dynasties (420 – 589 CE), a creolization occurred between Chinese and the Turkic, Mongolic, and Manchu language speakers who dominated the heartland of China. Significant changes included (but were not limited to) relexification, morphological restructuring, and phonological shifts (Mair 2010a: 23).

  [^10]: The *Qièyùn*, published in 601 CE, was one of the most influential rhyming dictionaries. Rhyming writing was an extremely important part of the *kēyŭ* – and played an important role in standardizing pronunciation. The *Qièyùn* is our best source for understanding the pronunciation of its time. It was repeatedly revised, annotated, and republished. Though there are disagreements about certain details, the consensus is that the standard of pronunciation it contains was the official standard, and that it is based on the Zhongzhou dialect, possibly with some features from other dialects, especially that of Nanjing.

  [^11]: The term “Mandarin” was first used to refer to the standard language of educated people and officials in the Ming and Qing dynasties, as European missionaries used it to translate the term *guānhuà* ‘language of the officials, or mandarins.’ In linguistic and dialectological circles, Mandarin is used to refer to northern dialects called *bĕifāng fāngyán* or *guānhuà fāngyán*. In popular usage, however, Mandarin refers to modern standard Chinese, or *pŭtо̄nghuà*(Coblin 2000: 537).

  [^12]: Beijing pronunciation was known as *bĕiyīn* ‘Northern pronunciation’, while the standard pronuniciation went by a variety of names such as *guānhuà* ‘Mandarin’, *zhèngyīn* ‘standard pronunciaton’, *Hànyīn* ‘Han pronunciation’, *guānyīn* ‘official pronunciation’, or even *tо̄ngyīn* ‘general pronunciation’.

  [^13]: Quoted in Coblin 1997: 285

  [^14]: In *Modern Chinese: History and Sociolinguistics*, Ping Chen describes it as “more of an attitudinal stance on what was supposed to be the standard language in polite society…rather than a reference to a specific speech form that was clearly defined, effectively promoted, conscientiously learned, and extensively used.”

 [^18]: 1. A *Guóyŭ Diàochá Zо̆nghuì* ‘General Committee for the Survey of the National Language’ will be set up in Beijing, with branches set up in all provinces. It will conduct a survey of dialects with respect to vocabulary, grammar, phonology, and other related aspects.
    2. On the basis of the results of the survey in all provinces, the General Committee is to decide on the standards of *guóyŭ* by selecting what is elegant, correct, and popular with regard to vocabulary, grammar, and phonology. Textbooks and dictionaries of *guóyŭ* will be compiled in conformity with the standard.
 
 [^19]: 3. A standard of pronunciation will be determined. It will be mainly based upon the Beijing dialect. The *rù* ‘entering’ tone, however, should be preserved. The vocabulary and grammar should be mainly based upon *guānhuà*, and meet the criteria of being correct, elegant, and logical.
    4. A standard phonetic alphabet should be decided on.
 
 [^20]: 5. *Guóyŭ* Instruction Schools will be set up by the Ministry of Education, which will train students from provinces. Graduates will return to their respective provinces to train more teachers. Teaching staff in schools and colleges who cannot speak *guóyŭ* must receive training in these schools. Apart from being taught as a specific subject, *guóyŭ* should gradually become the medium of instruction for all subjects

  [^23]: More specifically, there were three major differences between the *guóyŭ* and the standard Beijing dialect at the time. See footnotes 24-26 for the changes (from Chen 2004: 18): 
 
 [^24]: 1. Three voiced consonant initials \[v\]:, \[n\]:, and \[ŋ\]:, are retained for some characters, although they have either disappeared or become allophonic with other sounds in the Beijing dialect.
 
 [^25]: 2. Palatal initials before high front vowels in the Beijing dialect evolved from two distinct sources from Medieval Chinese, dental sibilants and velars. The former are called *jiān* ‘sharp’ initials, and the latter *tuán* ‘round’ initials. It was stipulated in the old national pronunciation that the initials that are derived from the sharp sounds should retain the previous pronunciation as dental sibilants, while those derived from the round sounds should become palatals. For example, in spite of the fact that there is no difference in pronunciation in the Beijing dialect between the corresponding characters in the two groups, *jīng* ‘refined’, *qīng* ‘blue, green’ and *xīng* ‘star’ are annotated differently in the old national pronunciation from *jīng* ‘warp’, *qīng* ‘light’, and *xīng* ‘mood’ (\[tsiŋ\]: \[tshiŋ\]: and \[siŋ\]: vs. \[tçiŋ\]: \[tçhiŋ\]: and \[çiŋ\]:) as the palatal initials in the first three words were derived from dental sibilants in Medieval Chinese. Although the *jiān/tuán* distinction is retained in some dialects, the two series of initials have completely merged in the Beijing dialect.
 
 [^26]: 3: The *rù* tone is treated as a toneme, which is supposed to have distinct phonetic manifestations, although characters belonging to this tonal group in Medieval Chinese no longer have any distinctive phonetic features in the Beijing dialect of the twentieth century.
 
 [^27]: Even though the writing system had been such a key link among the different Chinese dialect groups and was “a highly visible symbol of the Chinese throughout their long imperial history”, it was actually criticized heavily for being “backward”, “clumsy”, “abominable”, and so on. This path was politically viable because at the time China was taking a utilitarian approach to progress. More importantly, though, was the fact that a long, shared cultural history *already existed*. In the end, Romanization never occurred due to internal (and later external, in the from of Japanese troops) turmoil. When the drive to modernize Chinese returned in the 1950s, support for Romanization was replaced with support for simplification of the script instead.

  [^28]: Ramsey 1987: 9

  [^29]: This decision came with the publication of a new dictionary featuring 12,219 characters and variants and a brand new phonetic system for clarifying their pronunciation called the *Glossary of Frequently Used Characters in National Pronunciation”* (*Guóyīn chángyòng zìhuì*).

  [^30]: For a large swath of the population – the native speakers of non-Mandarin dialects – however, the standard written language would remain distant from their everyday, spoken dialects.

  [^31]: Simpson 2016: 93

  [^32]: Between 1956 and 1964 over 2,500 simplified characters were introduced.

  [^33]: Originally, *pŭtо̄nghuà* had generally referred to substandard language, and in the 1930s had been used to identify dialects that diverged from the standard. At the conference in 1955 it was reassigned the meaning of “common”, thus making it essentially a synonym of *guóyŭ*. The idea was to avoid the word *guóyŭ*, as it seemed possibly too Han-centric to be used as a national standard, given that there were more than fifty officially recognized ethnic groups in China who speak over eighty different languages (Chen 2004: 25).

  [^34]: Simpson 96

  [^35]: According to the symposium, Putonghua was defined by its phonology, lexicon, and grammar as follows (Chen 2004: 24): "*Pŭtо̄nghuà* is the standard form of Modern Chinese with the Beijing phonological system as its norm of pronunciation, and Northern dialects as its base dialect, and looking to exemplary modern works in *báihuà* ‘vernacular literary language’ for its grammatical norms."

  [^36]: In fact, the goal of the committee was less to work out common pronunciations, as there was not much to discuss, and more to deal with borderline cases.

  [^37]: Of no surprise is the fact that Putonghua ability is significantly higher in Mandarin-speaking areas, given the similarity of Mandarin dialects and Putonghua. In non-Mandarin-speaking areas, Putonghua ability indicated education. For example, in a study conducted in mountainous regions where Southern Min dialects are spoken, all of those who have any proficiency in Putonghua have received formal education, while those who are only able to understand it but not speak it have received little to no education (Chen 2004: 30).

  [^42]: This vernacular writing continues unabated in Hong Kong and overseas, especially in the United States, where some 86% or so of Chinese Americans trace their origins back to Guangdong. As Chen (2004: 51) puts it, overseas, “to speak Chinese more often than not means the ability to speak Cantonese, rather than Northern Mandarin or other dialects.” With regards to Cantonese writing in mainland China, as well as the writing of other dialects, one of the major concerns with the suggestion to Romanize the script was that this would enable dialectal writing, something that since the Qing dynasty had been seen as a threat to unity (Simpson year: 96).

  [^39]: Written Chinese has always been either *wényán*, which was based upon Old Chinese, or Mandarin. That means that anyone educated in writing could only have written in either of those two language, but *never in their own topolect.* Thus they (and the person with whom they are communicating) would have to know one of those two languages in order to communicate with someone else speaking a mutually unintelligible topolect. In other words, it is a myth that all Chinese dialects share the same written language. Furthermore, in the case of different dialects being written in Romanized form or other systems, the differences between the dialects would make it impossible for a reader of one dialect to understand what was written in another. 

  [^40]: Ramsey (1987: 16) comments that the general method for a speaker of one variety of Chinese to learn another variety is not really a formal process. Rather, it is just “picking up” the new variety through contact with others and through learning a few general rules about pronunciations that are different from what they are used to.

  [^41]: Ramsey 1987: 16. Mair (1991: 11) argues, however, that the term “Chinese language” – usually referring to (Modern Standard) Mandarin – as such is problematic, as *the Chinese people do not call their own language “Chinese.”* When Indians call their language Hindi, we refer to the language as Hindi, and so too we should follow the Chinese in calling the language Mandarin, which actually is an accurate translation of the term it is supposed to represent, *guānhuà.*
